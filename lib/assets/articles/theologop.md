NOTE:  You can watch the youtube video of the interview [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXwFzMbwADQ&feature=youtu.be).

This week I interview a fellow Austinite, Lady TheoloGOP.  A former evangelical with a plethora of knowledge and understanding of religion, how people view religion, and how this effects our politics.
