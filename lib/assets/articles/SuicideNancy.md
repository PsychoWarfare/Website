Hi <First Name>
<Your company name> is a provider of <product> specializing in <value proposition>.
We have been able to help companies like <competitor of theirs> by <solution> and I was hoping for a few minutes of
 your time to get a better understanding of your <product> needs to see what we can do for you as well.
There is room on my calendar on Tuesday morning. Would you be able to free up a few minutes for a short call?
Regards,
