A great interview with Jim Mosquera, an awesome writer who teaches readers about economics through his writing.

[Chandler Scott](http://www.jimmosquera.com/index.php/book/2020-2/), a rising TV journalist, tries to connect the dots in a country mired in another financial crisis.  Cyber terrorists add to the flames of fear.  The public yearns for help from its leaders who respond in ways previously unimagined.  Politics and economics will collide during the Presidential election of 2020.   Chandler uncovers the seeds of the next crisis, a crisis that would shape the future of the United States of America and the world.

2020, the first book in the Chandler Scott series, is a fusion of historical events with a near-term look at the future.  It is a thriller so convincing in its accuracy that readers will be left to ponder if these events could actually come to fruition.
