Can free markets actually exist ?

A common notion of market fundamentalism / [neoliberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism), the ideology we have have been living under primarily since Ronald Reagan, is to let the market solve the problem.  Now, I define a free market as an economy with unobstructed intervention, meaning in an ideal free market, the government puts no restrictions on private industry.  Any “regulation” in a free market would simply be enforced by the competition of the market.  For example, if customers did not like that your oil business was polluting the lake or the town.  Someone could either start there own greener business to compete with the business or customers could stop supporting this business that is killing them.  However, in practice and in the long term, I believe neither of these mechanisms for market correction actually work.  

The term **Invisible Hand ** was coined by Adam Smith to describe unintended social benefits of individual self-interested action.  This glorious quest of individualism will uplift society and all those around them by pursuing there own needs.  The common fallacy of the free market is that through competition the consumer will benefit, both in price and quality.  

The mistake of the free market is the notion of what is free, when you have a market that is defined of winners and losers with no restrictions, nothing stops the winners from ensuring that they keep on winning.  Any producer who gains an advantage over the market will use that leg up on the competition to suppress and limit competition so they can be more dominant in the free market.  ** In reality, the goal of anyone entering a free market, is to ensure is there is no competition since they are told that there pursuit of wealth benefits all.**

Want an example ?   [Microsofts Bill Gates squashed innovation in favor of his software.](http://time.com/3553242/microsoft-monopoly/)

To be frank, if you put someone in a system that idolizes there own personal pursuit of greed over everything else, in practice they will seek out all possible paths to only propel there self interest at the detriment of anything else.  The free market system defines that as amoral not immoral.  **In conclusion, the invisible hand, does not exist.**

These are the worst examples of the pursuit of profit at all costs:

 * [Exxon Mobil](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/opinion/exxon-climate-change-.html)

In reality, there is no invisible hand that corrects the market, the pursuit of your own ideals eventually ends up with you benefiting and the rest of the world bearing the cost, [wether that be through lack of innovation because you pushed competitors out of the market](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-influence/real-reasons-marijuana-is-banned_b_9210248.html),  [externalizing the true cost of your product onto the environment](https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-06-07/imf-true-cost-fossil-fuels-53-trillion-year), [or violating human rights for an extra buck.](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/features/privatization/two/)
