The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy. - MLK Jr.

Hello, World!  My name is Alexander (AJ) Joseph Norton.  Welcome to my first podcast!  I hope to explore the deep dimensions of our minds, leaving no stone unturned.  I want to talk about health, books to read, as well as any other subject of interest.

This podcast is based on the **psychological warfare** going on in our minds every single day.  It is nothing to fear, but something to examine.  I want this podcast to be where you can grow, challenge yourself, enlighten yourself, and laugh along the way.

Thank you for starting this journey.  I hope all find it rewarding... :)  

If you ever want to be on the podcast, want to send my anything, feel free to email me at:
**aj@psychowarfare.com**.


**Introduce Yourself** :) - Leave a comment.
